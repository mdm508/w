- Cold reading is when you encounter a piece of text out of the blue with zero context and have to make sense of what the autor is saying. I noticed cold reading is the hardest part of word problems for me. Keeping focus on new information and holding it in mind. Practice is the only way to get better but a focused demeanor and attitude of openness to the new information can help.
